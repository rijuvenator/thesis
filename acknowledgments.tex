First, I would like to thank my CMS collaborators and colleagues, without whom this work would not have been possible.

The work on displaced dimuons was performed in collaboration with UCLA senior researcher Slava Valuev and UCLA postdoctoral researcher Alice Florent under the supervision of my advisor, Professor Robert Cousins, along with UCLA colleagues Jay Hauser and William Nash, and Institute of High Energy Physics Vienna colleagues including Wolfgang Adam, Alberto Escalante, Suchita Kulkarni, Ivan Mikulec, Sebastian Templ, and Claudia Wulz.
We also thank our colleagues and conveners in CMS who contributed valuable knowledge and discussions, including Juliette Alimena, Paul Lujan, Ivan Mikulec, Niki Saoulidou, and Adish Vartak.

The work on neutron background studies described in the appendix was performed in full collaboration with fellow UCLA graduate student Christian Schnaible under the supervision of our common advisor, Professor Robert Cousins.
Together, Christian Schnaible and I wrote a detailed draft of internal CMS Detector Note DN-2017/019, reproduced below.
Professor Cousins also provided editing assistance, particularly in \Sec~\ref{sec:datamc}.
I presented this work in a poster session at the 2017 European Physical Society Conference on High-Energy Physics (EPS-HEP), and wrote a conference note for the Proceedings.
Christian Schnaible presented this work in a talk at the the 2017 American Physical Society Meeting of the Division of Particles \& Fields (APS-DPF).

We also thank everyone on the CSC GIF++ team, the CMS UCLA group, and everyone whose work we have built on or partially reproduced and who have contributed valuable knowledge and advice, including Cameron Bravo, Tim Cox, Alice Florent, Jay Hauser, Misha Ignatenko, Vladimir Ivantchenko, Evaldas Juska, Alexey Kamenev, Andrey Korytov, Katerina Kuznetsova, Armando Lanaro, Paul Lujan, Alex Madorsky, Nick McColl, Hualin Mei, Yuriy Pakhotin, Vladimir Palchik, Victor Perelygin, Jian Wang, Wells Wulsin, and Piet Verwilligen.

This thesis includes material that is based upon work supported by the U.S.\ Department of Energy under Award Number {DE}-{SC}0009937.
