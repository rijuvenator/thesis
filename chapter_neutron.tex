\section{Abstract}
\vspace*{-0.5\baselineskip}
Among the many challenges to be brought by the high luminosities of the HL-LHC is the impact of increased hit rates in the cathode strip chambers of the CMS endcap muon system. These chambers are used for all levels of trigger as well as offline reconstruction. Neutrons induce background hits via nuclear interactions and capture, followed by gamma emission and (mainly) Compton scatter off electrons that subsequently ionize the chamber gas. This note describes recent efforts to improve the understanding of such neutron-induced background through detailed comparison of CMS pp collision data, \GEANTfour simulation, and the response of CMS cathode strip chambers placed in the CERN high-intensity gamma irradiation facility, GIF++. Projections for the effect of such neutron-induced background hits on muon triggering and reconstruction at the HL-LHC are described.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
The high-luminosity upgrade to the CERN LHC (HL-LHC) will bring not only increased access to discovering new physics but also increased background rates in CMS muon chambers \cite{Evans:2008zzb,Apollinari:2116337}. This note focuses on the study of neutron-induced background hits in CMS endcap cathode strip chambers (CSCs) due to their large active volume and forward placement in CMS \cite{CMS:1997dma,Chatrchyan:2009hb}. Neutrons induce hits in CSCs by producing photons, via either nuclear scattering or capture. These photons produce or scatter electrons, via Compton scattering, the photoelectric effect, or pair production; the ionization from these electrons can either corrupt hits from desirable tracks in the event, or add extra background hits. This note describes efforts to quantify and characterize the effects of this neutron-induced ionization through analysis of Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of neutron production and propagation in CMS, as well as of CMS proton-proton (\pp) collision data. The results are tied to analyses of muon test beam data at the CERN Gamma Irradiation Facility (GIF++), which allows us to study the effects of background radiation on CSC performance and project the effects of neutron-induced background to the conditions at the HL-LHC.

In the debris of \pp collisions, hadronic interactions liberate neutrons from CMS calorimeters, shielding, and various other detector structures. These neutrons can carry several \GeVns or more of kinetic energy, propagating throughout the experimental cavern, detector materials, and shielding. They lose kinetic energy through many scattering interactions over the course of several milliseconds, and if not captured sooner, are eventually cooled to thermal equilibrium with the cavern environment, carrying kinetic energies of around 0.025\unit{eV} (300\unit{K}). There are three main processes by which neutrons lead to photons: inelastic scattering, resonant capture on nuclei, and thermal capture on nuclei \cite{Kopecky:1997}.

Neutrons with several \MeVns of kinetic energy may scatter inelastically with detector and shielding material, producing one or more photons. In addition to undergoing inelastic scattering, neutrons may be captured by various nuclei, including iron, copper, and free hydrogen, resulting in excited isotopes of the original capturing nuclei with energies typically a few \MeVns greater than that of their ground states. The excited isotopes reach their ground states by emitting one or more photons. Resonant capture occurs when the kinetic energy of a neutron (typically of order \keVns) is such that the sum of the total neutron and target nucleus energies matches the total energy of a discrete excited state of the final-state isotope. For example, \chem{56}{Fe} has a resonant neutron capture cross section at a neutron kinetic energy of 1.1\keV \cite{Kopecky:1997}. Thermal capture occurs when neutrons have reached sub-eV thermal energies, in a regime where the cross section for capture increases with decreasing neutron velocity. Throughout this note, any reference to neutron capture refers to both thermal and resonant neutron capture unless otherwise specified. 

The photons produced from inelastic scattering and nuclear capture are typically of order \MeVns in energy. Once produced, the photons can propagate inside the gas volume of a CMS CSC where they predominantly scatter off electrons, but also produce electrons via pair production and the photoelectric effect. These scattered electrons can ionize the chamber gas and subsequently lead to background hits.

Such hits constitute an important source of background rates as well as contribute to aging of muon chambers. This note focuses on the effect that these increased background rates have on muon triggering and offline reconstruction of muons and measurement of their properties. 

The identification of neutron-induced hits in CMS data is complicated by the fact that data from a CSC is read out only if the CSC trigger electronics identify a potential muon track (trigger primitive) in that CSC \cite{Hauser:814259,Acosta:2002km,Acosta:200826}. A muon leading to a trigger primitive can induce other hits in the CSC via \eg bremsstrahlung or delta rays, or be accompanied by other charged particles from a jet in which the muon is embedded. Precision measurements of the ionization charge are read out through the main CMS data acquisition (DAQ) system only for a small fraction of the area of the CSC that is near the muon that generated the trigger, and are particularly vulnerable to hits from these extra particles. Thus, for most of the studies in this paper, we use instead the diagnostic information for the whole chamber that is passed to the DAQ by the trigger electronics (the so-called ``trigger path''). These trigger path data are much less precise than the high-precision charge data read out by the main DAQ \cite{Baarmand:1999ka}, but since they include information from the entire chamber, they allow us to look for neutron-induced hits in areas of the chamber that are further away from the muon that generated the trigger. With various additional selection criteria, sufficient samples of neutron-induced hits are obtained for detailed studies of rates in CMS CSCs, for comparison to simulated CMS data and GIF++ data.

\Sec~\ref{sec:csc_electronics} is a brief overview of cathode strip chambers and the on-chamber trigger electronics in the CMS detector. \Sec~\ref{sec:G4_neutron_sim} describes \GEANTfour simulation of the detector response to \pp collisions, including neutron-induced hits. \Sec~\ref{sec:selection} describes the selection criteria that we use to isolate a sample of neutron-induced hits in CMS CSC data. \Sec~\ref{sec:datamc} describes the procedure by which we normalize our neutron-induced hit counts into hit rates. \Secs~\ref{sec:GIF} and \ref{sec:chargeperhit} describe studies of GIF++ data and CMS CSC data from which we predict some effects of increased radiation in HL-LHC-like conditions. 

\section{Cathode Strip Chambers and Trigger Electronics in CMS}
%\section{Cathode Strip Chambers and Trigger Electronics in the CMS Detector}
\label{sec:csc_electronics}
%\subsection{The CMS Detector}
%The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of 6\unit{m} internal diameter, providing a magnetic field of 3.8\unit{T}. Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. Muons are measured in the pseudorapidity range $\abs{\eta} < 2.4$, with detection planes made using three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive plate chambers. Matching muons to tracks measured in the silicon tracker results in a relative transverse momentum resolution for muons with $20 <\pt < 100\GeV$ of 1.3--2.0\% in the barrel and better than 6\% in the endcaps, The \pt resolution in the barrel is better than 10\% for muons with \pt up to 1\TeV.

The CSC system in the endcap muon detection system of CMS \cite{Acosta:2002km} contains 540 chambers. Each endcap has 4 stations numbered from 1 to 4, and each station contains two or three rings of chambers. A chamber is uniquely specified by a string of the form ME$\pm S/R/C$, where $\pm$ refers to either the + or $-$ endcap, $S$ is the station number, $R$ is the ring number, and $C$ is the chamber number, \eg ME+1/1/36. Part of this notation may be omitted when referring to groups of chambers; for example, we refer to ME1/1 or ME2/1 chambers, \ie chambers in the innermost ring of the first or second stations, respectively, in either endcap.

\begin{figure}[p]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\dummyFigWidth]{figures/neutron/fig_CSC.pdf}
	\caption{Diagram and principle of operation of a CSC endcap muon chamber in CMS.}
	\label{fig:CSC}
\end{figure}

The ring of chambers in each station is perpendicular to the $z$ axis of CMS, with the narrow end of their trapezoidal shapes closer to the beam line. \Fig~\ref{fig:CSC} contains a diagram illustrating the principle of operation of a CSC. Each CSC is a multi-wire proportional chamber consisting of 6 layers, with each layer lying in an $r$-$\phi$ plane of CMS. Each layer contains a gas volume consisting of 50\% CO$_2$, 40\% Ar, and 10\% CF$_4$ in between a plane of copper cathode strips and a plane of anode wires. The strips extend from the narrow end to the wide end, along the $r$ direction, at constant $z$ and $\phi$ coordinates; the wires extend parallel to the narrow and wide ends, approximately along the $\phi$ direction, at constant $z$ and approximately constant $r$ coordinates. The wires are spaced 2.5--3.5\mm apart, arranged in groups of 5--16\mm (wire groups, or WG), and kept at a high voltage of 2900--3600\unit{V} with respect to the cathode strips. 

A muon ionizes the gas, and the resulting electrons drift towards the wires, causing an avalanche of charge that induces an opposite charge on the cathode strips. The notable feature of a CSC is excellent position resolution in the $\phi$ direction achieved by precision cathode charge readout and interpolation. Cathode trigger electronics include a comparator network, which provides half-strip hit position resolution in the trigger hardware. Cathode comparator hits give the layer and half-strip number and anode wire group hits give the layer and wire group number. A digitized detector hit -- a cathode strip hit or a wire group hit -- is referred to as a digi, and therefore the strip (or half-strip) number or wire group number may also generally be referred to as a digi number \cite{Hauser:814259,Baarmand:1999ka,Acosta:200826}.

\begin{figure}[p]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\dummyFigWidth]{figures/neutron/fig_CSC_electronics.pdf}
	\caption{Diagram of the CSC electronics system in CMS.}
	\label{fig:CSC_electronics}
\end{figure}

As illustrated in \FigDot~\ref{fig:CSC_electronics}, the anode wire group hits and comparator half-strip hits are transmitted to circuits that perform low-level local pattern recognition on the hits in the six layers of a chamber. Candidate tracks from charged particles are identified separately in the cathode strips and anode wires and then combined. Anode local charged tracks (ALCTs) are formed by ALCT boards, which receive data for each plane from anode front end boards (AFEBs). Cathode local charged tracks (CLCTs) are formed in two steps within the trigger motherboard (TMB) from data transmitted by cathode front end boards (CFEBs). First, a set of loose requirements, for example on the number of layers hit, are applied to the CFEB data. These are known as the pre-trigger, and a candidate track that passes these requirements is called a pre-CLCT. Then, a set of tighter requirements are applied, and a pre-CLCT that passes these requirements becomes a CLCT. The TMB also receives ALCTs from the ALCT boards and combines coincident ALCTs and CLCTs to create local charged tracks (LCTs). The CSC electronics firmware has programmable requirements for the various pattern recognition steps, \eg for the number of layers hit, the spatial distribution of the hits, the temporal distribution of the hits, and the time window for coincidence of the ALCTs and CLCTs. 

These trigger data, referred to as trigger primitives, are transmitted to the endcap muon trigger system and also inserted into the DAQ stream via the DAQ motherboard (DMB). For offline use, the DMB also reads out the high-precision analog-to-digital converter (ADC) charge measurement for each cathode strip when the DMB receives a signal from the CMS \Lone trigger. However, these ADC charge measurement data are read only from CFEBs for which a pre-CLCT was formed, which correspond to only a fraction of a chamber. As noted above, muon-induced background hits make these data of limited use in our current studies of neutron-induced hits.

The data from the TMB contains both early and late detector hits with respect to the muon that generated the trigger are inserted into the DAQ stream. Hit times are binned into 16 readout time bins of 25\unit{ns} each, with the muon usually inducing hits in time bins 7 or 8. The chamber electronics can thus read out detector hits that occur approximately 200\unit{ns} (8 time bins) before and after the muon hits.

\section{\GEANTfour MC Simulation for Neutron Studies}
\label{sec:G4_neutron_sim}
\subsection{\GEANTfour MC Simulation Setup}
To better understand the basic nuclear interactions that may result in background hits in CSCs, we turn to simulation. We used the \GEANTfour simulation package to simulate minimum-bias proton-proton (\pp) collision events \cite{Agostinelli:2002hh,Allison:2006ve,Allison:2016lfl,Sjostrand:2006za}. To study neutron background effectively, a few specific modifications to the default CMS simulation configurations were necessary~\cite{PietsPage};

\begin{figure}[htbp]

	\includegraphics[width=\dummyFigWidth]{figures/neutron/neutronSpectrum_before.pdf}\\
	\includegraphics[width=\dummyFigWidth]{figures/neutron/neutronSpectrum_after.pdf}
  \caption[Histogram of neutron kinetic energy just before nuclear capture, before and after enabling thermal treatment of detector nuclei.]{Histogram of neutron kinetic energy just before nuclear capture, (\posstyle{top}) before and (\posstyle{bottom}) after enabling thermal treatment of detector nuclei. The dashed line indicates 0.025\unit{eV}. Before enabling the new feature, the low energy peak of captured neutrons is several orders of magnitude below thermal energies; after enabling the feature, the low energy peak is at thermal energies. Also visible are the resonant capture peaks on, for example, \chem{56}{Fe}, in the \keVns range.}
	\label{fig:nKE}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
	\item To accommodate the long lifetimes of the neutrons under study, we extended the tracking time of all particles to 10\unit{s}.
	\item To accommodate the low energies of the neutrons under study, we removed any particle energy thresholds where they existed.
	\item To properly model low-energy neutrons, we enabled a feature in the \GEANTfour thermal neutron scattering routine that models nuclei at room temperature. The standard \GEANTfour routine models the temperature of the nuclei in the detector at 0\unit{K} and as a result artificially cools neutrons down to well below thermal energies. \Fig~\ref{fig:nKE} displays histograms of the kinetic energy of neutrons just before their capture on a nucleus, before and after the new feature was enabled. The dashed line is at 0.025\unit{eV}; without the feature enabled, the low energy peak of captured neutrons is well below thermal energies, whereas with it enabled, the low energy peak is at thermal energies.
	\item To retain all electronics signals in simulated CSCs, we assigned simulated hits produced after times longer than 200\unit{ns} a time of 200\unit{ns} in the CSC digitization simulation module. This is to ensure that all hits from a single simulated \pp collision are retained, rather than just the hits that occur within the simulated detectors' limited time readout window of 400\unit{ns}.
\end{itemize}

Two versions of \GEANTfour neutron interaction packages are compared:

\begin{itemize}
	\item HP: ``High Precision'' package that parametrizes existing experimental nuclear data for neutron interaction cross sections, and
	\item XS: intended for CPU time optimization, derived from HP by approximating detailed parameterizations in HP with averages.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results from MC Simulation}
In examining these simulated events, we find that each \pp collision can lead to three broad categories of neutron-induced hits:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Hits on the time scale of 100\unit{ns} after the \pp collision, induced by ``fast'' neutrons whose energies have degraded over time to a few \MeVns. The neutrons interact inelastically with nuclei, resulting in some ionization from protons or nuclear fragments, but primarily resulting in nuclear de-excitation photons that give rise to ionizing electrons, primarily from Compton scattering.

	\item Hits on the time scale of several\mus after the \pp collision, induced by neutrons whose energies have degraded over time to energies of a few \keVns. The neutrons are resonantly captured on various types of nuclei, also resulting in nuclear de-excitation photons that give rise to ionizing electrons.

	\item Hits on the time scale of several ms or longer after the \pp collision, induced by thermal neutrons whose energies have degraded over time to be at thermal equilibrium with the experimental cavern. The neutrons are captured on nuclei, also resulting in nuclear de-excitation photons that give rise to ionizing electrons.
\end{itemize}

  \caption[Final energy of simulated neutron \vs the time since \pp collision giving rise to simulated detector hit, for hits in CSCs.]{Final energy of simulated neutron \vs the time since \pp collision giving rise to simulated detector hit, for hits in CSCs. Hits are induced by electrons that are produced from photons that are produced from neutron capture or from neutron inelastic scattering. Red dots indicate simulated hits induced by neutron captures, and blue dots indicate simulated hits induced by neutron inelastic scatters. The top plot shows hits from photons only, coming from inelastic scattering and nuclear capture; the bottom plot shows all neutron-related hits, including those induced by protons and nuclear fragments, shown in magenta and green dots, respectively.}
	\label{fig:tof_energy}
\end{figure}

\Fig~\ref{fig:tof_energy} displays plots of the final energy of simulated neutrons \vs the time (since the \pp collision) of the corresponding simulated detector hits (SimHits) in CSCs. The final energy of the neutron refers to the energy of the neutron at the moment it gives rise to the photon that eventually gives rise to the electron that produced the SimHit. Visible on the top plot are the three categories of hits as mentioned above: two groups of red dots that are hits induced by neutron captures; and blue dots that are hits induced by neutron inelastic scatters. The bottom plot in \FigDot~\ref{fig:tof_energy} shows the same quantities for all neutron-related SimHits, including the photon-induced hits as well as hits from ions (green) and protons (magenta).

Since the time scales from when the neutrons are created to when neutron capture induces hits are much longer than time scales of LHC bunch train gaps \cite{Evans:2008zzb}, hits occur in chambers uniformly at all times during an LHC fill. In simulation, we distinguish thermal neutron capture-induced hits in CSCs from prompt and fast neutron-induced hits by selecting the simulated hits that occur after a sufficiently long time after the \pp collision.

\end{figure}

\Fig~\ref{fig:hrz_neutron_cap} is an $r$-$z$ view of the CMS cavern showing the location of neutron captures that lead to SimHits in the CSCs, each dot colored according to the capturing nucleus. Neutrons are mainly captured on \chem{56}{Fe} (red), \chem{63}{Cu} (green), and \chem{1}{H} (blue) within the CMS endcap muon system, CMS calorimeters, and LHC shielding.

The most common process by which electrons that eventually lead to simulated hits are formed is Compton scattering.}
	\label{fig:electron_proc}
\end{figure}

Of additional interest are the processes by which photons produce the electrons that result in SimHits. \FigDot~\ref{fig:electron_proc} is a histogram of the simulated photon energy emitted by nuclear de-excitations from both inelastic scattering and neutron capture that lead to SimHits, stacked by the specific production or scattering process that created the ionizing electron. Photons that lead to SimHits predominantly have energies of hundreds of \keVns to several \MeVns, and the most common process that leads to SimHits is Compton scattering.

\section{Selection and Isolation of Neutron-Induced Hits in CMS Data}
\label{sec:selection}
To obtain a sample of events in \pp collision data suitable for studying the neutron background, we first select events with \PZ boson candidates decaying to two opposite sign muons from the SingleMuon dataset from Run 2016H, corresponding to approximately 9\fbinv of integrated luminosity. Events are chosen with at least two muons of opposite sign where the muon leading in \pt is required to have $\pt > 30\GeV$, and the subleading muon is required to have $\pt > 20\GeV$. In addition, muon candidate tracks are required to have at least one hit in the pixel detector, hits in at least six silicon-strip tracker layers, and segments in two or more muon stations. To suppress non-prompt muons, the sum of the \pt of charged tracks within a cone of $\Delta R=0.3$ around the muon is required to be less than 10\% of the muon \pt. Also, the muon is required to have a transverse impact parameter of less than 2\mm and a longitudinal distance of less than 5\mm with respect to the primary vertex. The \PZ boson dimuon candidates are selected within an invariant mass window of 60--120\GeV. We thus obtain a sample of prompt muons with reduced hadronic activity near the muon candidate. Finally, at least one of the muons is required to have passed through at least one CSC, by requiring that an LCT in at least one CSC was matched to the muon candidate track. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\dummyFigWidth]{figures/neutron/CornerSelection.pdf}
	\caption{Opposite half selection for neutron-induced hits in CSCs.}
	\label{fig:corner}
\end{figure}

We then look for evidence of neutron-induced hits in cathode comparator half-strip hits and anode wire group hits in the data of each CSC thus selected. To reduce potential muon-induced contamination of our selection of candidate neutron-induced hits, we require that there be exactly one LCT occurring in a one-sixteenth corner of a chamber and consider only comparator half-strip or wire group hits occurring in the opposite half of the chamber from the LCT. \Fig~\ref{fig:corner} displays an example diagram of a CSC with a muon (indicated by the black arrow) passing through a chamber corner (shaded in red) and the corresponding opposite half of the chamber (shaded in blue) where we look for hits. This ensures that any potential muon-induced background is at least a quarter chamber spatially separated from the region of the chamber in which we search for candidate neutron-induced hits.

As a precise clarification of what is meant by a one-sixteenth corner and an opposite half, an example definition of a chamber corner area is the overlap region between wire groups 1 through $N_\text{WG} / 4$ and comparator half-strips 1 through $N_\text{HS}/4$, where $N_\text{WG}$ and $N_\text{HS}$ are the total number of anode wire groups and comparator half-strips in a chamber, respectively. The corresponding area for the opposite half of the chamber in which we search for candidate neutron-induced wire group hits is the area defined by wire groups $N_\text{WG}/2$ through $N_\text{WG}$, and similarly for candidate neutron-induced comparator half-strip hits is the area defined by $N_\text{HS}/2$ through $N_\text{HS}$. All four definitions of a chamber corner and their corresponding opposite halves are considered and used in this analysis. 

Since the rate of trigger muons varies over the CSC system, 
the number of times we look in each half-chamber varies for each
half-chamber in the CSCs and for each event, and the hit rates vary with
luminosity. We introduce some rather tedious bookkeeping to
compute rates in the next section, with an indicator function used
to specify when we look.

\begin{figure}[tbp]

	\includegraphics[width=\dummyFigWidth]{figures/neutron/BXstructure.pdf}
	\caption{Histogram of bunch crossing number in a particular CMS data taking period during LHC proton-proton collisions in 2016, showing the gaps of various sizes in the LHC bunch structure.}
	\label{fig:bunch_structure}
\end{figure}

The LHC proton beam has 3564 bunch places, with a bunch spacing of 25\unit{ns}. Not every bunch place has protons in it; rather, consecutive bunches of protons occur in trains, separated by gaps \cite{Evans:2008zzb}. Proton-proton collisions occur in CMS when bunches of protons cross, called bunch crossings (BX). \Fig~\ref{fig:bunch_structure} is a histogram of LHC bunch place numbers for a high statistics run. The non-empty histogram bins correspond to bunch places that are filled with \pp collisions, displaying the LHC bunch structure. In this run, trains with protons are exactly 48 bunches long and the trains are separated by bunch gaps of 8 to 35 bunch places, with the final train followed by the LHC abort gap of approximately 200 bunch places.

%In each event read out by the CMS DAQ, anode wire hits are read out from CSCs in 16 time bins of 25\unit{ns}. 
%As mentioned in \Sec~\ref{sec:csc_electronics}, hits in time with the muon occur in the middle of the readout window in time bin 8, so that time bins read out before time bin 8 correspond to earlier bunch places. Early-time hits found in events triggered by muons from \pp collisions in the first BX after a gap correspond to times within the gap, \ie during bunch places without any \pp collisions. Thus they must arise from \pp collisions before the gap (apart from the rare cosmic or noise hit), and we attribute them to neutron-induced hits from long-surviving neutrons, \ie neutron capture. Events with muons in time with the first few BX after a gap can also be used as long as the neutron-induced hits are early enough to fall within the gap. 

%Similarly, events with muons triggered just before the beginning of the gap have late-time hits that correspond to times in the gap. As the LHC bunch trains often have exactly 48 consecutive BX with collisions between gaps, for convenience we consider only trains of 48 BX that occur after gap of at least 35 bunch places.

In each event read out by the CMS DAQ, anode wire hits are read out in 16 time bins of 25 ns. As mentioned in \Sec~\ref{sec:csc_electronics}, hits in time with the muon occur in the middle of the readout window in time bin 8; time bins before time bin 8 then correspond to earlier bunch places. Hits from these early-time time bins where the readout was triggered by a muon from pp collisions in the first BX after a gap correspond to times within the gap. That is, these hits occur during bunch places without any pp collisions. Thus, they must arise from pp collisions from before the start of the gap (apart from the rare cosmic or noise hit), and we attribute them to be neutron-induced hits from long-surviving neutrons, i.e. from neutron capture. Events with muons that are triggered in the first few BXs after a gap can also be used to identify neutron-induced hits as long as the early-time time bins are early enough to occur within the gap. 

Similarly, events (triggered by muons) at the end of a bunch train have late-time time bins that correspond to times within the beginning of the next bunch gap. As the LHC bunch trains often have 48 consecutive BX with collisions between gaps, for convenience we consider only bunch trains that are exactly 48 BX long and that occur after gaps of at least 35 bunch places. 

\Fig~\ref{fig:rainbow} is a 2D histogram of the CSC anode wire hits (intensity given by color code) as a function of the number of bunch crossings after a gap on the $y$~axis and the digi readout time bin on the $x$~axis. Both BX and time bins are 25\unit{ns} wide. Time bin 8 is in-time with the muon that triggered readout of the chamber.

% Blotting out the appendices for now
%Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_rainbow} contains similar plots for all chamber types, for both wire group hits and comparator half-strip hits.

The region bounded by the lower left red outlined triangle contains early readout time hits in early bunch places, \ie hits recorded near the end of an LHC bunch gap. This triangle contains neutron capture induced hits with negligible contribution from cosmic muons. The excess hits in readout time bin 0 contain hits from the previous bunch crossing due to the length of electronic pulses and are therefore not considered. We use the bins selected within the lower left triangle as the final step in isolating neutron capture induced hits. 

The central red outlined rectangle is a region delineating early readout time hits in bunch places contained completely within a bunch train. Hits from these bunch crossings consist of, in addition to neutron capture induced hits, hits induced by fast neutrons and hits in time with \pp collisions from other bunch crossings occurring in out-of-time readout time bins. The upper right red outlined triangle is a region delineating hits in late bunch places, \ie hits recorded at the beginning of an LHC bunch gap. Hits from these bunch crossings contain not only neutron capture induced hits, but also hits induced by fast neutrons (neutrons which have not yet lost enough energy to be captured) that occur within a few bunch crossings of a \pp collision. \Tab~\ref{tab:time_windows} summarizes the time windows for each of the three regions outlined in \FigDot~\ref{fig:rainbow}.

In summary, we select neutron capture induced hits in CMS data using the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Triggering muons must be from \ZMM candidates in SingleMuon Run 2016H
	\item Exactly one LCT must be in a one-sixteenth corner of a chamber
	\item Digis must be in the opposite half of the chamber from the LCT
	\item Digis must be found at early times in events occurring in the first few bunch places in a train of size exactly 48 bunch places, after a bunch gap of at least 35 bunch places
\end{itemize}

\section{Results and Comparison of CMS Data with MC Simulation}
\label{sec:datamc}
\subsection{Computation of Neutron-Induced Hit Rates}
With the selection of neutron-induced hits in CMS data as well as the
understanding gained from neutron simulation at CMS, we examine the
local $r$ and $\phi$ distributions of neutron-induced hits within a
given chamber type, as well as the neutron-induced hit rate for a
given chamber as a function of instantaneous
luminosity \cite{Cousins:687399,CMS-PAS-LUM-17-001}. Directly
comparing CMS data and MC simulation requires careful normalization of
the digi counts. This section describes how the samples of
neutron-induced hits obtained using the procedures discussed in
\Sec~\ref{sec:selection} are normalized, and various
neutron-induced hit rates are defined.

As discussed in \Sec~\ref{sec:selection}, neutron captures
typically occur many bunch places after the \pp collisions that
created the neutrons, so that, to a good approximation,
neutron-induced hits uniformly populate all bunch places in the
LHC. Observation of early-time neutron-induced hits during a
particular triggering bunch crossing necessarily implies contributions
from many \pp collisions in many previous bunch crossings at CMS. In
the steady state of approximately constant instantaneous luminosity,
we can associate the aggregate number of all neutron-induced hits to
the aggregate number of all \pp collisions, even though the \pp
collisions are not uniformly spaced in time at CMS, having significant
gaps between bunch trains. This association is the basis for all our
rate calculations.
%Note from Bob: I decided that it was not a good idea to think about
%BX spatially ``around the ring'', but rather temporally at CMS

Since we connect rates of neutron-induced hits to approximately
constant instantaneous luminosity, it is convenient to use the
instantaneous luminosity as measured over a ``lumi section,'' a time
interval of data taking at CMS of about 23\unit{s}. We consider any
changes in instantaneous luminosity within a lumi section to be
negligible. We further consider edge effects from neutrons created
during one lumi section but detected during another to be negligible.
(The effects on the two ends of the a lumi section tend to cancel in
any case.)

As further discussed in \Sec~\ref{sec:selection}, the
neutron-induced hits that we observe are a random sample of the steady
stream of hits, where the number of samples varies from half-chamber
to half-chamber within CMS and with each event, according to the
selection criteria described. Thus, in order to normalize our
neutron-induced hit rates, we keep track of the number of times we
look for hits in each half chamber as well as the steady state rate
of \pp collisions at the times we look.

The bookkeeping accounts for each 2D bin in \FigDot~\ref{fig:rainbow},
each readout time bin and bunch place after the gap.  The details are
described in the next sections; here we define some variables to be
used.

Each ring specifies a different chamber type, represented by
$c$. These chamber types contain different numbers and sizes of wire
groups and half-strips; we let $d$ (for digi) represent a particular
wire group or half-strip within a given chamber type. The counts also
vary with the particular bunch place $b$ after a gap and the
particular readout time bin $\tau$ in which we look.

\subsubsection{Computation of Neutron Hit Rate in CMS Data}

To determine the neutron-induced hit rate in CMS data, we count the
number of selected digis found in particular bunch places after a gap
and particular time bins in one of the red outlined regions in
\FigDot~\ref{fig:rainbow}. These regions consist of a set $B$ of bunch
places after a gap, and a set $T(b)$ of time bins for each particular
bunch place $b\in B$ after a gap. \Tab~\ref{tab:time_windows}
enumerates each of the bunch places after a gap considered in each
region, consisting of a bunch place set $B$, the set of time bins
$T(b)$ for each bunch place, and the total number of time bins
$N_{T(b)}$ for each bunch place.  For all $b$ not in the table, $T(b)$
is the empty set.

We process our data as a series of DAQ events, as described in
\Sec~\ref{sec:selection}.  In the following, ``event'' refers to a
DAQ event, which corresponds to a trigger at a particular bunch
crossing leading to a complete readout of the detector. The event data
of course contains hits from many \pp collisions, including (in the
out-of-time time bins) hits from \pp collisions in other bunch
crossings.

We formalize our notation for counting the number of neutron-induced
digis in a somewhat tedious manner in order to help with the
bookkeeping that follows for keeping track of the associated \pp
collisions.

Let $N_\text{events}^\text{CMS}$ be the number of events in the data
set used; we let the index $i$ run over the events considered, so that
$i=1, \ldots, N^{\text{CMS}}_{\text{events}}$.

Let $b(i)$ be the number of the bunch place after a gap for event $i$.

Then $T(b(i))$ is the set of time bins examined in event $i$, either
the bins listed in \Tab~\ref{tab:time_windows} for the region under
study, or the empty set.  (For example, if the region under study is
the ``Lower left triangle'', then $T(b(i))$ is the empty set for $b(i)
> 5$.)

A chamber type $c$ represents multiple chambers in a ring; let $c_j$
represent the $j$th chamber in chamber type $c$, and let $N_c$
represent the total number of chambers of type $c$, so that
$j=1, \ldots, N_{c}$.


Let $I_\text{look}(i, c_j, d)$ denote an indicator function
representing whether or not we looked in wire group or half-strip $d$
of chamber $j$ of chamber type $c$ in event $i$.  That is,
$I_\text{look}(i, c_j, d)$ is 1 whenever $d$ is in a half chamber in
which we looked in event $i$, and 0 otherwise.

%hit counting begins here

Let $I_\text{hits}(i, c_j, d, \tau)$ denote an indicator function
representing whether or not a hit is present in time bin $\tau$ of
wire group or half-strip $d$ in chamber $j$ of chamber type $c$ in
event $i$.  That is, $I_\text{hits}(i, c_j, d, \tau)$ is 1 whenever a
hit is present, and 0 otherwise.

The product of the two indicator functions is 1 whenever we look for
hits and find them.  For each event $i$, we sum the product of the
indicator functions over the time bins examined for event $i$, then
over chambers of type $c$, and then further sum over events.

We thus obtain $N_\text{hits}^\text{CMS}(c, d)$, the number of digis
found in the data set in the examined time bins of chamber type $c$
and wire group or half-strip $d$:

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:indicator_nHits}
	N_\text{hits}^\text{CMS}(c, d) = 
        \sum_{i=1}^{N^\text{CMS}_\text{events}}
        \sum_{j=1}^{N_c} \ 
        \sum_{\tau\in T(b(i))}
        I_\text{look}(i, c_j, d) \times
        I_\text{hits}(i, c_j, d, \tau). 
\end{equation}

As is evident, this sums over all chambers of type $c$.  One may divide by
$N_c$ to get the average number of hits in one chamber of type $c$.

% pp collision computation begins here
%
We also formalize our notation for counting the number of $\pp$
collisions to be associated with the hits found.  This is complicated
by the varying luminosity (or equivalently, varying pileup and/or
fraction of LHC filled with bunches).

Given the association between the steady state number of \pp
collisions and the steady state number of hits, the number of \pp
collisions associated with event $i$ is given by the mean number
of \pp collisions during the time interval in which we look.  The time
interval in which we look in one time bin $\tau$ is the that of a time
bin in the CSC readout, namely 25 ns.  This is also the length in time
of a bunch place in the LHC.  Thus the associated number of \pp
collisions in event $i$ is given by the mean
number of \pp collisions \emph{per bunch place}, averaged over all
bunch places at CMS (including empty bunch places), when event $i$ was
acquired.
%Note from Bob: I decided that it was not a good idea to think about
%BX spatially ``around the ring'', but rather temporally at CMS
The latter is a product of two quantities: the mean number
of \pp collisions per {\em bunch crossing $P_i$} (also referred to as
pileup) for event $i$, as reported by the CMS BRIL group;
and the fraction of filled bunch places (bunch places that have bunch crossings),
which we call $f_\text{fill}$, and which is
approximately 0.62 for the data used in this analysis. 

We let $N^\text{CMS}_{\text{\pp}}(c, d)$ be
the total number of associated \pp collisions 
in the data set at wire group or half strip $d$ in chamber type
$c$. It is the number of associated \pp collisions, summed over all events:

\begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:nPP}	
	N^\text{CMS}_\text{\pp}(c, d) = 
        \sum_{i=1}^{N^\text{CMS}_\text{events}}
        \sum_{j=1}^{N_c} \ 
        \sum_{\tau\in T(b(i))}
        I_\text{look}(i, c_j, d) \times
        P_i \times f_\text{fill}
\end{equation}

As in \Eq~\ref{eqn:indicator_nHits},
this sums over all chambers of type $c$, and one may divide by
$N_c$ to get the average for one chamber of type $c$.

The sum over $\tau$ in \Eq~\ref{eqn:nPP} counts the same \pp
collisions more than once in an event $i$; this is because we may look
in more than one time bin, and the goal is to have a normalization for
each time bin, and hence for hits found.

%hits per pp begins here

Dividing \Eq~\ref{eqn:indicator_nHits} by \Eq~\ref{eqn:nPP}, we obtain
the number of hits per \pp collision {\em per wire group or
half-strip $d$} in chamber type $c$:

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:hits_perPP_perDigi}
\text{hits per \pp per $d$} = 
      \frac{N_\text{hits}^\text{CMS}(c,d)}{N_\text{\pp}^\text{CMS}(c,d)}.
\end{equation}

To convert \Eq~\ref{eqn:hits_perPP_perDigi} to a per area quantity, we divide by the area subtended by each wire group or half-strip $d$ in a chamber type $c$, denoted $A_\text{digi}(c, d)$. The neutron background hit rate per \pp collision per area at CMS is given by

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:hits_perA_perPP_perDigi}
\text{hits per \pp per area at $d$} = 
   \frac{1}{A_\text{digi}(c, d)}  \  \frac{N_\text{hits}^\text{CMS}(c,d)}{N_\text{\pp}^\text{CMS}(c,d)}
\end{equation}

The average neutron background hit rate per area for the entire chamber type $c$ is obtained by summing \Eq~\ref{eqn:hits_perPP_perDigi} over the set of possible wire groups and half-strips in a chamber type, denoted $D(c)$, and dividing by the chamber area $A_\text{CSC}(c)$:

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:hits_perA_perPP_perCSC}
\text{hits per \pp per area, avg.\ over $c$} = 
   \frac{1}{A_\text{CSC}(c)}  \  \sum_{d\in D(c)}{\frac{N_\text{hits}^\text{CMS}(c,d)}{N_\text{\pp}^\text{CMS}(c,d)}}
\end{equation}

To convert \Eqs~\ref{eqn:hits_perA_perPP_perDigi} and \ref{eqn:hits_perA_perPP_perCSC} to per time quantities, we choose a reference luminosity $\pazocal{L}_0$ and multiply by the mean \pp collision rate per time at that luminosity, $N_\text{\pp}^\text{CMS}/t$. That is,

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:hits_perA_perT_perDigi}
\text{hits per \pp per area per time at $d$} =  
  \frac{1}{A_\text{digi}(c, d)}  \  \frac{N_\text{hits}^\text{CMS}(c,d)}{N_\text{\pp}^\text{CMS}(c,d)}  \  \left.\frac{N_\text{\pp}^\text{CMS}}{t}\right|_{\pazocal{L}_0}
\end{equation}

and similarly for the number of hits in the entire chamber,

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:hits_perA_perT_perCSC}
\text{hits per \pp per area per time, avg.\ over $c$} =   
  \frac{1}{A_\text{CSC}(c)}  \  \sum_{d\in D(c)}{\frac{N_\text{hits}^\text{CMS}(c,d)}{N_\text{\pp}^\text{CMS}(c,d)}} \  \left.\frac{N_\text{\pp}^\text{CMS}}{t}\right|_{\pazocal{L}_0}
\end{equation}

We obtain the mean \pp collision rate, $N_\text{\pp}^\text{CMS}/t$,
via two related methods. In the first method, we multiply the 
measured \pp interaction cross section and the
instantaneous luminosity:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:sigmaPP_x_lumi}
    \left.\frac{N_\text{\pp}^\text{CMS}}{t}\right|_{\pazocal{L}_0} = \sigma_\text{\pp}  \  \pazocal{L}_0
\end{equation}

In  the second method, we multiply the mean pileup $P_0$ at a reference luminosity $\pazocal{L}_0$ by the fill fraction $f_\text{fill}$, and divide by 25\unit{ns}, the bunch spacing interval. 

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:PU_x_ff_over_BS}
	\left.\frac{N_\text{\pp}^\text{CMS}}{t}\right|_{\pazocal{L}_0} = \frac{f_\text{fill}  \  P_0}{25\unit{ns}}  \  \frac{10^9\unit{ns}}{\text{s}}.
\end{equation}

Both methods for measuring $N_\text{\pp}^\text{CMS}/t$ should give the same answer if we use the same cross section
as used by the CMS BRIL group when computing pileup numbers \cite{Sirunyan:2018nqx,PileupTwiki}.
We favor the second method of computing $N_\text{\pp}^\text{CMS}/t$ because it uses only quantities which are directly provided by the CMS BRIL group. 

In either case, the \pp collision rate can in principle be scaled to other luminosities:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:PU_x_ff_over_BS_scale}
	\left.\frac{N_\text{\pp}^\text{CMS}}{t}\right|_{\pazocal{L}} = 
	\left.\frac{N_\text{\pp}^\text{CMS}}{t}\right|_{\pazocal{L}_0}  \  \frac{\pazocal{L}}{\pazocal{L}_0}.
\end{equation}
Consistency checks are shown in \FigsDot~\ref{fig:dppdt_vs_L} and \ref{fig:lumi_vs_pu}.

\Fig~\ref{fig:dppdt_vs_L} is a plot of the measured $N_\text{\pp}^\text{CMS}/t$ \vs instantaneous luminosity via the second method described above. In the plot, each black dot in the plot represents a single luminosity section and the slope of this line corresponds to the \pp interaction cross section, $\sigma_\text{\pp}$. From \FigDot~\ref{fig:dppdt_vs_L} we read off the \pp collision rate at any instantaneous luminosity. At the reference luminosity \reflumi, $N_\text{\pp}^\text{CMS}/t \approx 7\times10^8 \unit{\text{\pp}/s}$.  

\Fig~\ref{fig:lumi_vs_pu} shows a plot of instantaneous luminosity \vs mean pileup. Each dot in the plot represents a single luminosity section and is color coded according to the $f_\text{fill}$ for that data taking period. Approximately 95\% of the data collected corresponds to $f_\text{fill} = 0.62$. As a check that the two methods for calculating $N_\text{\pp}^\text{CMS}/t$ are equivalent, lines are drawn according to the $f_\text{fill}$ of various data taking conditions and the measured \pp interaction cross section \cite{Bawej:1711011, Sirunyan:2018nqx}.

\subsubsection{Computation of Neutron Hit Rate in CMS as a Function of Luminosity}
\label{sec:hit_rate_vs_lumi}

The above hit rates per \pp collision are independent of luminosity, and the per time rates are with respect to a reference luminosity. In this section we check the implicit assumption of linearity of rates with luminosity. We count the number of neutron hits, binned by the luminosity of the event in which the muon that generated the trigger occurred, and normalize to the number of times we look, binned by luminosity. 

At the risk of confusion, we let $\pazocal{L}$ refer to a luminosity {\em bin} centered on $\pazocal{L}$ , and let $I_\text{lumi}(i, \pazocal{L})$ denote an indicator function representing whether or not event $i$ occurred with a luminosity within luminosity bin $\pazocal{L}$. Then the computation of hit rates within
luminosity bins is the same as in \Eq~\ref{eqn:indicator_nHits}, 
with the addition of an indicator function to specify the luminosity bin.

We thus obtain $N_\text{hits}^\text{CMS}(c, d, \pazocal{L})$
the number of digis found in the data set in the examined time bins of
chamber type $c$ and wire group or half-strip $d$, in luminosity bin $\pazocal{L}$:

\begin{equation}
 	\label{eqn:nHits_Lumi}
        N_\text{hits}^\text{CMS}(c, d, \pazocal{L}) = 
        \sum_{i=1}^{N^\text{CMS}_\text{events}}
        \sum_{j=1}^{N_c} \ 
        \sum_{\tau\in T(b(i))}
        I_\text{look}(i, c_j, d) \times
        I_\text{hits}(i, c_j, d, \tau) \times
        I_\text{lumi}(i, \pazocal{L}). 
\end{equation}

The normalization for each luminosity bin, $N^\text{CMS}_\text{looks}(c,
d, \pazocal{L})$, is the sum of the number of times we looked in the
luminosity bin as in \Eq~\ref{eqn:nPP}, without the factors counting \pp
collisions:

\begin{equation}
 	\label{eqn:nLooks_Lumi}        
        N^\text{CMS}_\text{looks}(c, d, \pazocal{L}) = 
        \sum_{i=1}^{N^\text{CMS}_\text{events}}
        \sum_{j=1}^{N_c} \ 
        \sum_{\tau\in T(b(i))}
        I_\text{look}(i, c_j, d) \times
        I_\text{lumi}(i, \pazocal{L}).
\end{equation}

Then we can define rates similar to those defined in \Eqs~\ref{eqn:hits_perPP_perDigi}--\ref{eqn:hits_perA_perPP_perCSC} that are functions of luminosity:

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:hits_perLook_perDigi_Lumi}
\text{normalized hits per $d$} = 
   \frac{{N}^\text{CMS}_\text{hits}}{N^\text{CMS}_{\text{looks}}}(c, d, \pazocal{L})
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:hits_perA_perLook_perDigi_Lumi}
\text{normalized hits per area at $d$} = 
  \frac{1}{A_\text{digi}(c, d)}  \  \frac{{N}^\text{CMS}_\text{hits}}{N^\text{CMS}_{\text{looks}}}(c, d, \pazocal{L})
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:hits_perA_perLook_perCSC_Lumi}
\text{normalized hits per area, avg.\ over $c$} = 
  \frac{1}{A_\text{CSC}(c)}  \  \sum_{d\in D(c)}{\frac{{N}^\text{CMS}_\text{hits}}{N^\text{CMS}_{\text{looks}}}(c, d, \pazocal{L})}
\end{equation}

To convert \Eqs~\ref{eqn:hits_perA_perLook_perDigi_Lumi} and \ref{eqn:hits_perA_perLook_perCSC_Lumi} to per time quantities, we observe that each time we look corresponds to a 25~ns time interval readout time bin, and also one bunch space. Therefore, the neutron hit rate in chamber type $c$ as a function of luminosity is simply \Eq~\ref{eqn:hits_perA_perLook_perCSC_Lumi} multiplied by the conversion from time bin to ns:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:hits_perA_perT_perCSC_Lumi}
\text{normalized hits per area per time, avg.\ over $c$} = 
    \frac{1}{A_\text{CSC}(c)}  \  \sum_{d\in D(c)}{\frac{{N}^\text{CMS}_\text{hits}}{N^\text{CMS}_{\text{looks}}}(c, d, \pazocal{L})}  \  \frac{\text{time bin}}{25\unit{ns}}  \  \frac{10^9\unit{ns}}{\unit{s}}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Computation of Neutron Hit Rate in MC Simulation}

In MC simulation, we identify the neutron capture induced hits in each
simulated event by the long time that is recorded since the pp
collision of the event.  In the rest of this section, when we refer to
hits or digis, we refer to those with late enough times to be
identified as being induced by neutron capture.

There is no need for a selection process as described for the CMS
data (with LCTs in a corner, etc).  All digis in all chambers in all
simulated events are examined.  We again invoke the approximation
described in \Sec~\ref{sec:datamc} that we can associate the aggregate
number of all neutron-induced hits to the aggregate number of all \pp
collisions, even though the \pp collisions are not uniformly spaced in
time at CMS.  Thus we need not be concerned with recording the
hit-by-hit time bin of simulated hits, but rather work with totals and
averages.


At CMS, this steady-state number of neutron-induced hits per \pp
collision at CMS, measured in one time bin (25\unit{ns}), is the sum
of hits induced by neutrons originating from all previous pp
collisions. A key point is that it is not necessary to attempt such a
sum, which would be awkward computationally.  Rather, we note that
this sum is equal to the sum of all simulated neutron-induced hits
(in all future time bins) coming from a single simulated pp collision.


Let $N_\text{events}^\text{MC}$ be the number of simulated events
considered.

Let $N_\text{hits}^\text{MC}(c, d)$ be the total number of hits in
$N^\text{MC}_\text{events}$ at wire group or half-strip $d$ (for digi)
in chamber type $c$. In analogy with \Eq~\ref{eqn:indicator_nHits}, we
can write, using all hits in all times,

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:MC_nHits}
	N_\text{hits}^\text{MC}(c, d) = 
        \sum_{i=1}^{N^\text{MC}_\text{events}}
        \sum_{j=1}^{N_c} \ 
        \sum_{\text{all~}\tau}
        \ 1
\end{equation}

As with data, this sums over all chambers of type $c$.  One may divide
by $N_c$ to get the average number of hits in one chamber of type $c$.

We let $N_\text{\pp}^\text{MC}(c)$ be the normalization to \pp
collisions for this hit total. (We suppress the argument $d$ since
unlike data, all wire groups and half strips are examined in every
event.)  While one MC event corresponds to a single simulated \pp
collision, the sum over $N_c$ chambers in \Eq~\ref{eqn:MC_nHits} means
that a factor of $N_c$ is needed to consistently normalize, i.e.,

\begin{equation}
    N_\text{\pp}^\text{MC}(c) = N_\text{events}^\text{MC}  \  N_c
\end{equation}

Then the number of hits per \pp collision at $d$ is then

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:MC_hits_perPP_perDigi}
 \text{hits per \pp per $d$, MC} = 
    \frac{N_\text{hits}^\text{MC}(c,d)}{N_\text{\pp}^\text{MC}(c)}
\end{equation}

As in data, we convert $N_\text{hits}^\text{MC}(c, d)/N_\text{\pp}^\text{MC}(c)$ to a per area quantity by dividing by $A_\text{digi}(c, d)$. The neutron hit rate per \pp collision in MC simulation is thus given by:

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:MC_hits_perA_perPP_perDigi}
\text{hits per \pp per area at $d$, MC} = 
	\frac{1}{A_\text{digi}(c, d)}  \  \frac{N_\text{hits}^\text{MC}(c, d)}{N_\text{\pp}^\text{MC}(c)}
\end{equation}

and similarly for the number of simulated hits in the entire chamber,

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:MC_hits_perA_perPP_perCSC}
\text{hits per \pp per area, avg.\ over $c$, MC} = 
	\frac{1}{A_\text{CSC}(c)}  \  \frac{1}{N_\text{\pp}^\text{MC}(c)}  \  \sum_{d\in D(c)}{N_\text{hits}^\text{MC}(c, d)}
\end{equation}

Finally, we convert \Eq~\ref{eqn:MC_hits_perA_perPP_perDigi} and \ref{eqn:MC_hits_perA_perPP_perCSC} to per time quantities by choosing a reference luminosity $\pazocal{L}_0$ and multiplying by the \pp collision rate per time at that luminosity, $N_\text{\pp}^\text{MC}/t$:

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:MC_hits_perA_perT_perDigi}
\text{hits per \pp per area per time at $d$, MC} = 	\frac{1}{A_\text{digi}(c, d)}  \  \frac{N_\text{hits}^\text{MC}(c, d)}{N_\text{\pp}^\text{MC}(c)}  \  \frac{N_\text{\pp}^\text{MC}}{t} 
\end{equation}

and

\Figs~\ref{fig:lumi_11} and \ref{fig:lumi_21} display plots of neutron-induced wire group hit rate without normalizing to \pp collisions (as in \Eq~\ref{eqn:hits_perA_perT_perCSC_Lumi}) \vs luminosity, for hits that occur at the end of LHC bunch gaps (lower left triangle from \FigDot~\ref{fig:rainbow}) and hits that occur during CMS \pp collisions (rectangle in \FigDot~\ref{fig:rainbow}), for ME1/1 and ME2/1 chambers, respectively. We plot the hit rate that is not normalized to \pp collisions, a quantity that is a function of luminosity, in order to see any potential linear dependence of hits \vs luminosity. Indeed, these plots show a relationship that is linear to the eye and intercepts the origin. This suggests that we have succeeded in isolating neutron capture induced hits, because contamination from muon-induced background would result in a positive offset on the $y$~axis. Fluctuations in the data points are presumably due to changes in data taking conditions; however, the size of the $\chi^2$/dof from the fit suggest that there are some systematic uncertainties that are not understood. 

\Figs~\ref{fig:wg_occupancy_11} and \ref{fig:wg_occupancy_21} display histograms of the neutron-induced wire group hit rate for CMS data and MC, \Eqs~\ref{eqn:hits_perA_perT_perDigi} and \ref{eqn:MC_hits_perA_perT_perDigi}, as a function of wire group number, in ME1/1 and ME2/1 chambers, respectively. We plot the hit rates that have been multiplied by ${N_\text{\pp}^\text{MC}}/{t}$ for a reference luminosity of \reflumi so as to compare data and MC, as in \Eqs~\ref{eqn:hits_perA_perT_perDigi} and \ref{eqn:MC_hits_perA_perT_perDigi}. Rates normalized to area and time for both MC simulation and CMS data are shown, for both the XS and HP cross section libraries. The agreement is good to a factor of 2, depending on chamber type. The agreement in the HP plot of ME2/1 is anomalously good, presumably by chance.

In preliminary results in 2017 for the neutron induced hit rates, we incorrectly normalized the number of hits we counted with respect to the number of pp collisions in CMS data. Specifically in \Eq~\ref{eqn:nPP}, we omitted the fill factor, which changes the result for data by about a factor of 0.62 with respect to MC simulation. In addition, the way we expressed the rates per time was ambiguous and confusing; we trust that the current methodology is more clear.

\subsection{Neutron Hit Patterns}
A neutron-induced electron that leaves hits in more than one strip or layer is potentially more disruptive to reconstruction than one that leaves a single isolated hit. It is of interest to see if the MC simulation reproduces digi patterns of single, double, and triple hits found in CMS data. From the selected neutron digis, we consider contiguous clusters of at most 3 half-strips $\times$ 3 layers, \ie $\phi$-$z$ patterns, and study patterns for both CMS data and MC simulation.

\Fig~\ref{fig:pattern} displays histograms of the neutron-induced hit $\phi$-$z$ pattern distribution for CMS data and MC simulation. The $x$~axis bin labels each show a representation of the half-strip \vs layer pattern; the horizontal direction in each is half-strips, and the vertical direction in each is layers. The sections of plots are colored by the number of hits in each pattern; on the far left in green is the only 1-hit pattern, followed by all possible 2-hit patterns in blue, and finally all possible 3-hit patterns in orange. The shaded histogram bins indicate patterns that have comparators on adjacent half-strips on the same layer. Since trigger electronics only report comparator hits on adjacent half-strips if they are in different time bins, the occupancy of these patterns should be suppressed compared to patterns to which they are otherwise geometrically similar. Comparing the shaded histogram bins in \FigDot~\ref{fig:pattern} to the unshaded histogram bins suggests that this is indeed the case.

The distribution of neutron-induced hit patterns is overwhelmingly single, isolated hits. Both the occupancy of each pattern type and the relative ratio between singles, doubles, and triples, as well as to each other, show rough agreement between CMS data and MC simulation.

\section{Muon Test Beam Studies at GIF++}
\label{sec:GIF}
\subsection{The GIF++ Experimental Setup}
The CERN Gamma Irradiation Facility (GIF++) is located on the CERN Pr\'{e}vessin site in the H4 beam line extracted from the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) \cite{Pfeiffer:2016hnl}. The SPS delivers a beam of 400\GeV protons on a fixed target, providing a charged particle beam of hadrons decaying to a beam primarily consisting of muons with a broad momentum spectrum around 100\GeV. The facility includes a 13.9\unit{TBq} \chem{137}{Cs} gamma ray irradiation source emitting primarily 662\keV photons with the means to attenuate the source over a large range. Two CSCs (one ME1/1 and one ME2/1) are placed within the facility. This setup is used for studying aging, gas gain, high-luminosity conditions, \etc, in preparation for the HL-LHC.

\Lone Trigger Accepts (L1As) from muons, triggering chamber readout, can be produced in one of two ways. The first way is by self-trigger, where L1As are produced by chamber electronics forming Local Charged Tracks (LCTs) using coarsely correlated anode wire and cathode strip hits. Variables under control in the experimental setup include the chamber anode high voltage, the gamma ray source intensity (via attenuating filters, allowing a range of intensities from fully open to nearly closed as well as completely off), and the firmware of the controlling electronics, which defines various settings such as hit multiplicity thresholds. The second way to produce L1As is by external trigger, where L1As are produced by the triple coincidence of three scintillators in the beam: one upstream of the source, one downstream of the source, and one that is mounted in the path of the beam just in front of the chambers. The GIF++ data used in this note are externally triggered data taken during a muon test beam over a large range of GIF++ source intensities with CMS-like firmware parameters, and with a set of high voltages intended to equalize gas gain across all layers.

\subsection{LCT Efficiency and RecHit Displacement at GIF++}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.7\dummyFigWidth]{figures/neutron/Eff_11_LCTScint_L1A.pdf}
	\includegraphics[width=.7\dummyFigWidth]{figures/neutron/Eff_21_LCTScint_L1A.pdf}
  \caption[Plot of LCT efficiency divided by the efficiency at minimum HV current for ME1/1 and ME2/1 chambers at GIF++.]{Plot of LCT efficiency divided by the efficiency at minimum HV current (irradiation source turned off), for the (\posstyle{top}) ME1/1 and (\posstyle{bottom}) ME2/1 chambers at GIF++. LCT efficiency is defined as the number of LCTs created within a scintillator shadow, divided by the number of scintillator triggers received. As the source intensity is increased (chamber anode HV current is increased), the LCT efficiency drops. The gray line indicates an approximate equivalent HV current corresponding to design HL-LHC luminosity.}
	\label{fig:lct_eff}
\end{figure}

To measure the LCT efficiency, we begin by counting the fraction $f$ of L1As that have at least one LCT within the area shadowed by the middle scintillator mounted in front of the chambers. Due to issues of precisely defining the shadow and dealing with events with more than one muon, we do not attempt to define an absolute efficiency. Instead, we define a relative efficiency dividing the value of $f$ taken at higher source intensities by the value of $f$ with the GIF++ source off, denoted $f_\text{off}$. We estimate the scintillator area boundary empirically using a position scatter plot of LCTs, and count those LCTs whose layer 3 half-strip and wire group number fall within this boundary. \Fig~\ref{fig:lct_eff} displays plots of the LCT relative efficiency, $f/f_\text{off}$, as a function of chamber anode HV current induced by increasing the GIF++ source intensity for the ME1/1 and ME2/1 chambers at GIF++. As the gamma source intensity is increased, the number of photon-induced noise hits increases, and the number of LCTs constructed decreases.

%We identify two possible causes for the decrease in the number of LCTs created. The first possibility is that signal muon LCTs are lost due to the chamber electronics spending too much time processing a large number of low quality LCTs, causing signal LCTs to be missed. This phenomenon is referred to as dead time. The second possibility is that signal muon LCTs are lost due to corrupted hits induced by background. To study the first possibility, we tightened the threshold for the number of hits required to create a pre-trigger. \fixmeCOMMENTED{explain pre-trigger better} Muon LCTs are typically of high quality, consisting of five or six hits, so if the loss were indeed due to dead time, tightening the pre-trigger threshold would result in the electronics processing fewer low quality background LCTs, decreasing dead time, which in turn would decrease the chance of missing a high quality signal muon LCT. If on the other hand the electronics are not being saturated with high background rates, tightening the pre-trigger threshold would simply further decrease the number of LCTs constructed.

%\end{figure}

%Figure~\ref{fig:lct_eff_withTight} displays two plots of LCT efficiency divided by the efficiency at minimum chamber current (GIF++ source off), as a function of chamber anode current for the ME1/1 and ME2/1 chambers at GIF++. The red circles are data taken with the same hit thresholds as CMS, and the blue squares are data taken with the CLCT pre-trigger threshold tightened by one hit, \ie the requirement was tightened from 3 hits to 4 hits. \fixmeCOMMENTED{not convincing} The LCT efficiency at a given current is strictly lower in data taken with the tightened pre-trigger threshold, compared to the CMS threshold. We therefore infer that dead time is not a significant source of LCT efficiency loss, and turn to the second possibility: that the LCT efficiency loss is due to corrupted hits.

Each display is organized by the gas gap layer and the strip or wire number in which the response occurred. The quantity A represents the attenuating factor applied to the 13.9\unit{TBq} \chem{137}{Cs} gamma irradiation source and I is the chamber anode wire HV current.

This display illustrates a mechanism by which a photon hit can displace a muon hit; the reconstructed hit in layer 3 was displaced and subsequently excluded from the segment fit.}
	\label{fig:rh}
\end{figure}

One possible cause for the loss of signal muon LCTs is the corruption of muon hits induced by background. To understand the characteristics of hit corruption, we examine CSC event displays such as in \FigDot~\ref{fig:ed}. These event displays show wire group hits, comparator half-strip hits, and strip ADC counts with the layer on the vertical axis and the digi number on the horizontal axis. The color for the wire groups and comparators indicates the digi time bin, while the color for the strip ADC counts indicates the ADC counts. The comparator hit plot has an overlay in black rectangular outline of the LCT pattern that was used to identify the LCT.

This particular event display illustrates a way that a photon-induced hit may cause loss of LCTs, and consequently, loss of offline reconstructed segments. The display shows a muon triggering readout and forming a 4-hit LCT, whose comparator pattern can be seen in half-strips 9--13. The strip ADC counts show a large energy deposit that we attribute to a photon-induced hit in strips 3--4 in layer 3. The corresponding comparator hit in half-strip 7 is shifted away from what would have been its correct position in approximately half-strip 11. This results in what would have been a 5-hit LCT deteriorating to a 4-hit LCT. This ability of photon hits to displace hits can in this way cause loss of LCTs as well as deterioration of their quality.

\Fig~\ref{fig:rh} is a display of the corresponding offline reconstructed hits (RecHits) \cite{Barashko:2007zz}, along with an overlay of the muon segment constructed from them. The RecHits that contributed to the segment are shown in red. The shifted comparator hit and the photon energy deposit resulted in a RecHit that was displaced to the left, resulting in its exclusion from the segment. This directly results in a deterioration of segment reconstruction resolution.

The white line indicates an approximate equivalent HV current corresponding to design HL-LHC luminosity.}
	\label{fig:seg_frac}
\end{figure}

\Fig~\ref{fig:seg_frac} displays stacked plots of the fraction of reconstructed muon segments spatially closest to muon LCTs within the scintillator acceptance area, categorized by the number of hits used to form that segment, as a function of chamber anode HV current for the ME1/1 and ME2/1 chambers at GIF++. The plot shows that the fraction of high quality segments formed with 6 hits decreases as the source intensity is increased, while the fraction of lower quality segments formed by 3 hits increases. This confirms that LCT loss can be caused by a loss of hits, and demonstrates the mechanism by which neutron-induced hits can potentially disrupt CSC detector performance.

\section{Charge per Hit Studies at GIF++ and in CMS Data and Simulation}
\label{sec:chargeperhit}

As discussed in \Sec~\ref{sec:GIF}, the GIF++ facility allows us to study the performance of CSC online and offline reconstruction under conditions that potentially correspond to the radiation environment expected at the HL-LHC. To investigate the correspondence between GIF++ source intensity and LHC instantaneous luminosity, we examine the CSC anode HV current as measured by an ammeter in the CSC HV power supply (HVPS) of both CSCs at GIF++ and for similar chamber types at CMS.

eifferences in radiation environments produced from the GIF++ source and from LHC \pp collisions necessitate understanding the validity of using anode HV current for the correspondence between GIF++ and CMS. As noted in \Sec~\ref{sec:GIF} above, GIF++ photons are emitted with a maximum energy of 662\keV by the \chem{137}{Cs} source, and the resulting ionizing electrons are primarily from Compton scattering and the photoelectric effect. In contrast, photons originating from the neutron background in CMS can carry up to several \MeVns in energy and thus, in addition to more energetic electrons from Compton scattering and the photoelectric effect, ionizing electrons and positrons can arise from pair production. Because of these differences and to explore any others, we measure the\unit{charge/hit} of background hits that are expected to be the dominant source of charge in the anode HV current by measuring the ratio of the anode HV current to the anode wire group\unit{hits/s} in both CMS data and GIF++ data. 

\subsection{Computation of charge/hit from CMS data}

\subsubsection{ME1/1}
To calculate\unit{charge/hit} in ME1/1 chambers using CMS data, we take the ratio of the measured HV current (\unit{charge/s}) and the anode wire group\unit{hits/s}. Each of the measured HV current and anode wire group\unit{hits/s} are calculated at a fixed reference luminosity intended to be representative of a typical measured values of the HV current and\unit{hits/s}. We choose \reflumi as the reference luminosity.

We use anode HV current data collected by the HVPS and stored in an external database during LHC fills to calculate the HV current at the reference luminosity, which we refer to as the reference HV current. We read the HV current data offline from the database and correlate each HV current measurement by time to the corresponding measured LHC luminosity. In ME1/1 chambers, each layer constitutes an HV channel. We retrieve the HV current measurements for all ME1/1 HV channels, for all LHC fills during data taking period Run 2016H. We then study plots of anode HV current \vs luminosity and attempt to calculate the reference HV current by performing a two-parameter linear fit to the data and reading off the value of the fit at \reflumi. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\twoThirdsFigWidth]{figures/neutron/ME11_N_31_5_f5394_curr_lumi.pdf}
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\twoThirdsFigWidth]{figures/neutron/ME11_P_02_2_f5394_curr_lumi.pdf}
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\twoThirdsFigWidth]{figures/neutron/ME11_P_18_2_f5394_curr_lumi.pdf}
  \caption[Plot of anode HV current \vs LHC luminosity with a two-parameter linear fit for three ME1/1 channels.]{Plot of anode HV current \vs LHC luminosity with a two-parameter linear fit for (\posstyle{top}) a well-behaved ME1/1 channel, (\posstyle{middle}) an ME1/1 channel with a large fitted offset, and (\posstyle{bottom}) a noisy ME1/1 channel.}
	\label{fig:ME11_IvsL}
\end{figure}

However, since the HVPSs for the ME1/1 chambers at CMS are known to measure a non-zero offset of HV current at zero luminosity, some adjustment of the HV current is necessary. In addition, in some ME1/1 HV channels, the HVPS can produce very noisy measurements of the anode HV current, resulting in data that are inconsistent with a straight line fit. \Fig~\ref{fig:ME11_IvsL} displays three plots of anode HV current \vs luminosity. The top plot is an example of a well-behaved ME1/1 channel that does not have an offset in the vertical intercept, so that we can use it to calculate the reference HV current. The middle plot is an example of ME1/1 channels that have a large offset of 0.46\muA that needs to be corrected when calculating the reference HV current. The bottom plot is an example of a noisy HV channel where the HVPS reads out hundreds of values of the HV current within a short period of time where the measured values oscillate between two values separated by 0.6\muA and is not consistent with the model of a straight line fit.

To avoid problems such as large offsets and many oscillating values, we scanned through all 432 ME1/1 HV channels in LHC fill 5394. We selected what we thought were the best channels, similar in appearance to the top plot in \FigDot~\ref{fig:ME11_IvsL}, based on fit $\chi^{2}$, number of degrees of freedom, and our own judgment. We applied this list of 157 (out of 432 possible) selected channels for use in all other LHC fills considered. We considered a total of 23 fills in this study.

\end{figure}

\Fig~\ref{fig:fill_5394_curr_histo} is a histogram of reference HV current values at the reference luminosity from hand-selected channels with the offset required to be less than $\pm$0.1\muA. To obtain one characteristic HV current value for each fill, we take the average of the plus and minus endcaps. Then to combine the measurements over all fills, we take the average of the HV currents in each fill during Run 2016H, with each fill weighted by its integrated luminosity. The averaged HV current is then multiplied by 6 because each CSC chamber has six HV channels (one per chamber layer) which operate independently. The resulting total ME1/1 chamber HV current is 

\begin{equation}
	I_{\text{ME1/1}} = 11.3\muA
\end{equation}

at the reference luminosity.

	\label{fig:ME11_HvsL}
\end{figure}


To obtain the reference rate of anode wire group hits, we start by calculating the values of the\unit{hits/s} at the reference luminosity \reflumi from the slopes of one-parameter linear fit to plots of\unit{hits/s} \vs luminosity in \FigDot~\ref{fig:ME11_HvsL}. The top plot in \FigDot~\ref{fig:ME11_HvsL} is the ME1/1 wire group\unit{hits/s} \vs LHC luminosity (from \Eq~\ref{eqn:hits_perA_perT_perCSC} but without the $1 / A_\text{CSC}$ factor) for wire group hits that occur in LHC bunch gaps (lower left triangle from \FigDot~\ref{fig:rainbow}); the bottom plot is the same but for wire group hits that occur during \pp collisions (middle rectangle from \FigDot~\ref{fig:rainbow}). The reference rate of anode wire group\unit{hits/s} is sum of the hit rates of hits occurring in LHC gaps, $H_\text{LHC gap}$, and during LHC bunch trains, $H_\text{\pp-coll}$, weighted by the LHC bunch fill fraction, $f_\text{fill} = 0.62$,: 

\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
	\label{eqn:hit_rate_calc}
	H_{\text{WG-ME1/1}} &= f_{\text{fill}} \  H_\text{\pp-coll} + (1-f_{\text{fill}}) \  H_{\text{LHC gap}} \\
	&= 0.62  \  10.1\times10^6 \unit{hits/s} + 0.32  \  2.5\times10^{5} \unit{hits/s} \\
	&= 7.2 \times 10^{6}\unit{hits/s}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The\unit{charge/hit} is then calculated by dividing the anode HV current by the anode wire group\unit{hits/s}:

ME2/1 chambers each have 18 independent HV channels. Each of a chamber's six layers is divided into three HV segments: one HV segment, through which passes the highest current, is close to the beam line; one HV segment, through which passes a lower current, is in the center of the chamber; and one HV segment, through which passes the lowest current, is at the end of the chamber furthest from the beam line. \Fig~\ref{fig:ME21_curr_lumi_p214_5} displays plots of the anode HV current \vs luminosity for a representative example of ME2/1 chambers, ME+2/1/04 Layer 5, for all three HV segments.

	\label{fig:ME21_inTrain_occ}
\end{figure}

We start by calculating the rate of wire group hits in ME2/1 for the full chamber in the same way as ME1/1. \Fig~\ref{fig:ME21_HvsL} displays plots of the rate of ME2/1 wire group hits second for hits occurring at the end of LHC bunch gaps and during \pp collisions with a one-parameter linear fit through the origin. The slopes are again used as the reference hit rate and are combined according to \Eq~\ref{eqn:hit_rate_calc}. This gives an estimate of the hit rate in\unit{hits/s} for ME2/1, denoted as $H_\text{WG-ME2/1}$.

We then count the number of hits that occur within each HV segment. This number divided by the total number of hits in the chamber is the fraction of hits $f_{\text{ME2/1-}s}$ that occur in each HV segment, where $s=$1, 2, or 3 for each HV segment. The boundaries of HV segments are visible in \FigDot~\ref{fig:ME21_inTrain_occ} as dips in the occupancy plot at wire groups 45 and 81. HV segment 1 is taken as wire group numbers 1--45, HV segment 2 as 46--81, and HV segment 3 as 82--112. \Tab~\ref{tab:21_hit_frac} reports the hit fractions calculated from \FigDot~\ref{fig:ME21_inTrain_occ}. The rate of wire group hits in each HV segment at the reference luminosity is then obtained by multiplying the hit fraction for each HV segment to the full ME2/1 rate of wire group hits, 

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:ME21_HR_calc}
	H_{\text{WG-ME2/1-}s}=f_{\text{ME2/1-}s}  \  H_{\text{WG-ME2/1}}.
\end{equation}

These hit rates are also reported in \Tab~\ref{tab:21_hit_frac}. 

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\topcaption{Values of wire group hit fraction and hit rate in each ME2/1 HV segment.}
	\label{tab:21_hit_frac}
	\begin{tabular}{c|cc}
				& $f_{\text{ME2/1-}s}$    & $H_{\text{WG-ME2/1-}s}$ [hits/s]\\ \hline
	ME2/1       & -                       & 6.3$\times10^{6}$       \\ \hline

	ME2/1 S2    & 0.25                    & 1.5$\times10^{6}$       \\ \hline
	ME2/1 S3    & 0.12                    & 0.8$\times10^{6}$       \\ 
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The next step we take is to convert the luminosity values of all points in \FigDot~\ref{fig:ME21_curr_lumi_p214_5} to equivalent \unit{hits/s}. To do this, we multiply the luminosity value of each point, denoted $\pazocal{L}$, by the \unit{hits/s} at \reflumi, $H_{\text{WG-ME2/1-}s}$, in each HV segment.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:lumi_to_hitrate}
	\text{hits/s} = \pazocal{L} \times H_{\text{WG-ME2/1-}s}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}

	\label{fig:ME21_IvsH}
\end{figure}

This transformation from luminosity to equivalent \unit{hits/s} gives us the HV current as a function of\unit{hits/s} in each ME2/1 segment individually. \Fig~\ref{fig:ME21_IvsH} displays example HV current \vs \unit{hits/s} for ME+2/1/04 Layer~5 and Layer~6. 

At CMS, the non-ME1/1 chambers use a different HVPS system than the ME1/1 chambers. When the non-ME1/1 HVPS were commissioned in CMS, each HV channel in the non-ME1/1 chambers was independently calibrated from each other. As a check of this, we study plots of current \vs luminosity and we verify that it is not necessary to correct for fitted offsets when computing the fitted reference current values. However, we observe that for some non-ME1/1 chambers, there are layer-by-layer differences in current in a given chamber and given LHC fill at the same hit rate. \Fig~\ref{fig:ME21_IvsH} displays example HV current \vs \unit{hits/s} plots for ME+2/1/04 Layer~5 and Layer~6. The top plot (Layer~5) shows that when different HV segments in the same chamber have similar\unit{hits/s}, they do have similar HV currents. However, for some channels, a noticeable jump is observed in the HV current at similar\unit{hits/s}, as in the bottom plot (Layer~6). This discrepancy might be caused by some amount of miscalibration of the HVPS conversion of ADC to$\,$\muA. To avoid channels with possible miscalibration, we scan through plots of HV current \vs\unit{hits/s} for all layers of ME2/1 chambers and search for subjectively defined smooth transitions in HV current and\unit{hits/s} between each segment.

	\includegraphics[width=\dummyFigWidth]{figures/neutron/ME21_f5394_chph_sel_hist.pdf}

	\label{fig:ME21_fill_5394_chph_histo}
\end{figure}

We then calculate\unit{charge/hit} by dividing the $y$ axis value (HV current) by the $x$ axis value (hits$/$s) of each data point in the HV current \vs\unit{hits/s} plots for all three HV segments in each selected chamber layer. Each\unit{charge/hit} value is collected into a histogram for each LHC fill during run period H of 2016. One entry in this histogram is a single data point from plots of HV current \vs\unit{hits/s} in chamber layers that pass our selection. \Fig~\ref{fig:ME21_fill_5394_chph_histo} is an example of the\unit{charge/hit} histogram of selected chamber layers for each HV segment for LHC Fill 5394. (Fill 5394 was used to determine the selection of good ME2/1 layers.) HV segment 1 is the blue histogram, HV segment 2 is the green histogram, and HV segment 3 is the red histogram. HV segment 3 is bi-modal because at very low HV current (less than approximately 0.6\muA) the HV current ADC least count of approximately 0.1\muA is the dominant source of uncertainty which causes measured values of the HV current to fluctuate between the two closest least count values.

To obtain a\unit{charge/hit} value in each fill and HV segment, we use the mean of each of the\unit{charge/hit} histogram. Then finally, just as the HV current measurements in ME1/1 were combined, the\unit{charge/hit} for each HV segment in each LHC fill is averaged with a weighting according to the integrated luminosity of each fill considered. For HV segment 3 this procedure gives a 4\% larger\unit{charge/hit} than by computing the ratio of the HV current averaged over fills and the\unit{hits/s} from \Tab~\ref{tab:21_hit_frac}.

	\label{fig:GIF_IvsH}
\end{figure}

At GIF++, the\unit{charge/hit} for background hits is obtained by measuring the anode HV current and the rate of early time anode wire groups hits in externally triggered data at each source attenuation. \Fig~\ref{fig:GIF_IvsH} displays plots of the measured anode HV current as a function of the total number of anode wire group hits that occur in readout time bins 1--5 for the ME1/1 and ME2/1 chambers at GIF++ respectively. Each dot represents a single source attenuation, where the lowest source intensity yields the lowest HV current and lowest background\unit{hits/s}, and increasing the source intensity also increases the HV current and anode wire\unit{hits/s} roughly linearly. The slopes of the fitted lines represent the measured\unit{charge/hit} of each CSC. For ME2/1, only the first 8 points are used to calculate the slope, because at higher source intensities, the high HV currents passing through the internal resistance result in a non-negligible drop in the HV at the anode wire.

	\label{fig:cph_MC}
\end{figure}

In the HP neutron simulation as described above, each simulated wire hit can be associated to a quantity of simulated avalanche charge produced from the gas ionization. \Fig~\ref{fig:cph_MC} displays histograms of the simulated avalanche charges for ME1/1 and non-ME1/1 simulated wire hit. We take the mean of these histograms of total avalanche charge per simulated wire hit as a measure of\unit{charge/hit} in MC simulation for neutron-induced hits.

\end{table}

\Tab~\ref{tab:charge_per_hit} is the collection of all\unit{charge/hit} calculations in units of\unit{fC/hit} for ME1/1 and ME2/1 for CMS data, GIF++ data, and CMS simulation. 

To summarize the results: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item ME1/1\unit{charge/hit} at GIF++ is roughly a factor of 2.5 higher than at CMS
	\item ME1/1 MC\unit{charge/hit} matches ME1/1\unit{charge/hit} at CMS within 15\%
	\item ME2/1\unit{charge/hit} is a factor of 2--3 higher than ME1/1\unit{charge/hit} at CMS
	\item ME2/1\unit{charge/hit} at GIF++ is 20--30\% higher at GIF++ than at CMS
	\item ME2/1 MC\unit{charge/hit} is roughly 2--2.5 lower than ME2/1\unit{charge/hit} at CMS
\end{itemize}

These results are important for reconstruction studies, where the total\unit{hits/s} is the strongest indicator of trigger and software performance. This means that at equal\unit{hits/s} for CSCs at GIF++ and CMS (effects on muon reconstruction are roughly the same), the HV current will differ by the same amount as\unit{charge/hit}. So, when using HV current for correspondence between GIF++ source intensities and ME1/1, these results at face value imply that at an equal\unit{hits/s} the chamber at GIF++ will have a factor of 2.5 larger HV current than chambers in CMS. Similarly, for the ME2/1 chamber correspondence, the ME2/1 at GIF++ will have a 20--30\% larger HV current than the chambers in CMS assuming an equal\unit{hits/s} (depending on HV segment). However, further understanding of possible mis-calibration of HV current ADC to \muA conversion is necessary in the calculation of ME2/1\unit{charge/hit}.
