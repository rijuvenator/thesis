## Theory
  * Deal with $c = 1$ stuff in theory section
	  * "except when using the quantity $c\tau$, i.e. $c$ times the mean proper lifetime of a particle"
	  * don't call $c\tau$ lifetime -- look through

## CMS
  * 2808 bunches (I said up to, why is this a problem?) (It's not)
  * Largest magnet (I have no idea)
  * Sign of $|q|$ (but I said radius)

## Displaced
### Cuts
  * Cuts
	  * Define cut somewhere
  * Flowchart is correct
  * List punctuation
  * Showers of cosmic muons
	  * i.e. multiple cosmic muons arriving simultaneously from the same atmospheric shower initiated by a cosmic ray
  * Degrees of freedom

### BGest
  * A final set of DSA event --> confusing rephrase
  * Word smithing for P(D), etc.
  * Drell-Yan --> DY some places
  * Stuff about mu-hat-s
	  * To obtain the median of ZBi, we use mu-s as mu-s-hat

### Cutopt
  * ZBi asimov
  * Internal consistency
	  * consistency, or cross check
  * Drop sig fig from QCD TFs (one from each)
  * Probably fix CR w/ DY+QCD
	  * Put quotes
  * Statistical uncertainty in caption

### Stats
  * Say more about Gamma
	  * assumed to follow ... As shown in [ZBi], the gamma distribution has good frequentist properties; from a Bayesian point of view, it is the posterior pdf for the background mean if the prior pdf is uniform and the likelihood function is from one sample of a Poisson distribution
  * Asymptotic frequentist can be better
  * Within their prior probability
	  * within their pdfs
